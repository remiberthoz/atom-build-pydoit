# pydoit build-tool integration for Atom

Uses [*pydoit*](https://pydoit.org/) configuration to autodetect and run tasks
from Atom.

This packages requires the [build](https://atom.io/packages/build) package to be
installed.

Thanks to
[atom-build-make-file](https://github.com/tasnad/atom-build-make-file)
and [atom-build-make](https://github.com/AtomBuild/atom-build-make)
for creating their packages, which are helping me make this one!
